NOTE: anneal dates listed are taken from the "HST Observing Timeline
Reports." Prior to April 2012, these times refer to the *end* of the
hot phase of the anneal while April 2012 and later (with IR-cold),
these times refer to the beginning of the hot phase of the anneal. In
addition, the cooldown profiles are somewhat different before and after
April 2012: before, cooling took ~6 hours (with ~3 hrs of that spent at
~ -4C) while after, cooling takes ~3 hrs (no significant time at ~
-4C).

More information available at SIAF history page (http://sesd.stsci.edu/prd/sciopsdb/siaf/siaf_install.htm)

Jun 11,2012
-----------
WFC3 UVIS quad filter apertures changed from the geometric centers of
the quadrants to the center of the unvignetted areas.


Jun 13,2011
-----------

SIAF updates installed in SOGS 06/13/11: new apertures for use with IR
grism science using full-frame and 512x512 & 256x256 subarrays (OPR
66683).


Jul 14, 2010
------------

WFC3 aperture updates installed into OPUS (SCIOPSDB PR 65493). These
were small changes only (<1 mas), made to four matching apertures to
make the IR and UVIS V2V3's match exactly otherwise, unnecessary SAM
(small angle moves) were triggered. The matching apertures are designed
to supply an effective SAME-POS while changing apertures between UVIS
and IR. 

Apr 23,2010
-----------

WFC3 aperture updates installed into OPUS (SCIOPS PR 64983). Twelve new
apertures were defined: for quads (IUV1CA_2K2 IUV1CB_2K2 IUV2CC_2K2
IUV2CD_2K2), for two 512x512 apertures on quadrant C (the new
IUV2MC_512 and a shifted IUV2CC_512 [50 pix]), as well as two new 1Kx1K
apertures in C as well (IUV2MC_1K1 and IUV2CC_1K1). In addition,
there's a new aperture encompassing the full IR detector but which has
its reference point at the same V2V3 position as IRFIX, named
IUVISIRFIX. And, on the IR detector, there are three new apertures
which align with the IR positions (IIRUVISCTR, IIRUVIS, IIRUVISFIX) for
use by observers and one new aperture for use by APT only (IVTIRDEAD, a
circular aperture showing the dead area ["death star"] on the IR
detector. Finally, the positions of IUVISQA, IUVISQB, IUVISQC and
IUVISQD have been moved to the center of the most blemish free areas.
Note: names of these apertures follow the SIAF nomenclature; the phase
II proposal instructions list the corresponding APT names.

Feb 04, 2010
------------

Fix to SIAF installed on Jan 25,2010: sign error in V3 coordinate of IR
apertures caused by ~1" error in their positions. 

Jan 25,2010
------------

This delivery incorporates the distortion solution recently created by
Vera Platais. This has been used in conjunction with the focal plane
alignment measurement of December 2009 to obtain the best available
reference point positions, scales and orientations. The new solution is
4th order and so has 15 coefficients instead of 10 for each axis.
Compared to the Aug 3 delivery, UVIS reference points have shifted by a
few tenths of an arcsecond. The IR has moved by a little more than 1
arcsecond. The recalculated angles differ by up to 0.2 degrees. No
pixel positions have changed.

At 2020/225 02:57 a CU/SDF (SIC&DH) LOCK-up occurred. Error messages were received indicating the SI PIT Toggle Test and QBuf Transfer Status failed. MOSES SEs have confirm that this is a standard lockup event, and the HST Operations manager has given the go ahead to perform the CAROLInE expedited recovery activities. The FOT and MOSES SEs are going on-site to perform NSSC-I and SI those activities overnight, and P&S Ops has already generated and delivered the RTS Reload products. 

The Lock-up was covered by HSTAR 16933.  The following Ops Requests were completed.
−	21007/Complete   CU/SDF Lockup Recovery Part A, Recover SI C&DH to Fixed Format
−	21008   CU/SDF Lockup Recovery Part B/C, Recover to SIC&DH Normal / SI Recovery 
−	21009   CU/SDF Lockup Recovery Part D, Reload NSSC-1 GPTM 
−	21011   CU/SDF Lockup Recovery Part E/F, Uplink NSSC-1 SPC Load and Set ATP (RTCS Restore method) / QBF Restoration
−	21010  Configure ACS and WFC Mechanism for intercept
−	20745    Restore ACS NSSC-1 Limit check Look_Up Table for ROA
−	19682   -  Restore WFC3 CSM Motion Memory Monitoring
The Science Timeline will resume at 2020.225:23:39:22  (7:30pm EDT Wed, i.e. planned resumption ~ 20 hours after event.

HGA1 then later HGA2 moved suddenly, giving rise to  Low Body Rate failures at 181/10:10 and 181/22:06 and popping  gyros into high mode. FOT went on site to command the gyros back to low mode, clear the errors, and perform data and memory dumps.
 
Initial analysis: HGA splines are stopping suddenly when the HGA positions reach the software limits unexpectedly. Small number statistics but both times happened on long splines for TDRS Spare. New SMSs will use TDRS East rather than TDRS Spare. The next spline that is expected to have this problem is from 20.182 06:28:51 to 20.182 10:19:17 UTC.  FOT will be on site to respond if needed.  At that time, the FOT will also execute commanding to update the TDRS East orbital elements in the HST486 and load the truncation SMS products.

---> Turned out to be TDRSS spare ephemeris issue. PASS angle predictions vs FSW computations didn't agree and led to divide by zeros. Fix was to update the ephemeris on-board (it was 5 yrs old), it's working fine now. Going to update the other TDRSS ephemerii as well.

FHST alignment table updates

Ops Request 20923 was successfully completed at 150/13:13 to update the FHST alignment tables.  The table loads were verified by comparison with memory dumps.  The first FHST map following the update resulted in a good attitude determination as expected.  Additionally, the first guide star acquisition following the update was successful. 

Background
After Dec 2019 FGS alignment update, average FGS roll bias shifted from ~0 to ~50 ". Confidence in FGS alignment was high so FHST misalignment in V1 was suspected. The high V1 error is currently more of an issue than in the past because of ACR 7 which trips on high roll bias errors in order to catch losses of lock during the vehicle offset. Action was then: update the FHST alignment tables to remove a +52.6" error in roll and a -3.4" " error in pitch (computed from FHST MAP data from 2019.324-2020.092); also a small but insignificant yaw error found: +0.13").

HST entered into KFSP mode at 353/14:51 - ACR 5 tripped (autonomous command routine)


COS and STIS safed as expected. No other safing tests failed. Gyro performance has been stable thoughout anomaly.

PCS showed the attitude difference between the command reference frame and the Kalman Filter calculated attitude was greater than 4 degrees for more than 12 minutes, causing ACR 5 to trip [NOTE: ACR 5 changed from 12 to 15 min on Dec 20,2019] .  The excursion occurred due to the combination of a relatively static mag field and a spacecraft slew.

Excursions of this magnitude are not unusual, but the duration was longer than previously experienced. The spacecraft is in a safe configuration and there are no hardware issues that caused the safemode entry.  Given that, recovery to the nominal science timeline will begin this evening.
 
The safemode recovery commanding will begin at 353/23:33 UTC
STScI planning and scheduling is building a health and safety SMS that will begin at 354/0700 UTC.
The Return to Science SMS will begin at 354/1900 UTC

From Tom B.:
At 9:51am EST yesterday, Hubble entered “Kalman Filter Sun Point” (KFSP) safe mode.  All systems were nominal at the time.  This mode puts the observatory into a safe state for troubleshooting significant problems.  The entry into KFSP was triggered by a safeguard that looks for a discrepancy between the commanded and measured vehicle attitude; in this case, it turned out to be a false alarm from a noisy measurement of the vehicle attitude during a slew. 
 
After ensuring all systems (including the pointing control system) were behaving as expected, Hubble was returned to science operations this afternoon.  We are currently reviewing the autonomous command routine that safeguards against possible anomalies with the pointing control system so that we can reduce the chance of future false alarms while maintaining the safety of the observatory.

On Sunday, December 15, at ~1:45 PM EST, the 15th Control Unit/Science Data Formatter
(CU/SDF) lockup event occurred since its installation in SM4. At an anomaly telecon at 4:30 PM
EST, status and recovery plans were reviewed. The criteria were met for use of the new Stored
Program Command Timeline Reload Capability that reduces the time to resume the full science
timeline by employing breakpoints built into the command load products. The reload SMS was
delivered at 5:07 PM EST, and manual commanding to recover the payload was completed before
midnight. Nominal science operations resumed at 12:53 PM EST on Monday, December 16, 2019.
Use of the new Stored Program Command Timeline Reload Tool expedited recovery by ~14 hours.

SIC&DH CU/SDF Lock-up event occurred at 349/18:45 (HSTAR 16272; see briefing charts CUSDF_Lockup_Anomaly_Briefing_121519.pptx). It was agreed to proceed with the recovery and planned intercept time of 2019.350:17:53:48.
 

As of 2019/350/04:24 UTC, the third CU/SDF Lock-up recovery using the CAROLInE method has been successfully completed (reference HSTAR 16272). 
 
The Lock-up recovery COP 9.21, Parts A, B, C, D, E, and F were executed via Ops Requests 20793-20796.  These Ops Requests contained commanding to restore SIC&DH command and telemetry function, recover the SIC&DH to Normal mode, recover the SIs to their nominal SMS boundary states, reload the NSSC-1 GPTM, load the NSSC-1 N00 Reload and Restart SPC loads, set the ATP pointer for intercept, and return to QBF operations. 
 
Ops Request 20798 was successfully executed at 350/03:06 UTC to clear a NSSC-1 bad block count stemming from a period during an added MA forward support that dropped during the ESM recovery commanding.  Standing Generic Ops Request 20745 was completed at 349/23:07 UTC to restore the NSSC-1 patch to the ACS limit check look-up table to support ROA.  Standing Generic Ops Request 19682 to restore the WFC3 memory monitoring on the CSM motion was completed at 350/04:24 UTC. 
 
During the recovery, at approximately 350/01:40 UTC, the J-string crashed (reference HSTAR 16276) resulting in a switch to the I-string for commanding, where the remainder of the recovery (Parts D, E, F, ORs 20798 and 19682) were completed after successfully transferring the RTCS Reload products to the string. 
 
At this point, the Payload is ready to resume the on-going DOY 2019/350 SMS at the planned intercept point of 350/17:53:48 UTC.  Another FLASH report will be sent upon verification of successful resumption of the science timeline.
 
 

Dec 4,2019
----------
At 2019/338:02:35:36 HST reported an SI C&DH CU/SDF Lockup. At the anomaly review, HST Mission Operations agreed to the use of the new CaroLine expedited recovery method. This method allows rapid recovery of the NSSC command processing without the need to intercept and build an SI recovery/Return to Science SMS. The supporting expedited recovery products were generated and delivered in short order following the anomaly meeting. If the realtime recovery activities are accomplished as planned, the NSSC-1 ATP pointer will be set to resume SI command processing at 2019.338/13:37:49 UTC (8:37:49am EDT) Wednesday. 

As of 2019/338/12:49 UTC, the second CU/SDF Lock-up recovery using the CAROLInE method has been successfully completed.  Lock-up recovery COP 9.21, Parts D, E, and F were executed via Ops Requests 20780-0 and 20781-0.  These Ops Requests contained commanding to reload the NSSC-1 GPTM, load the NSSC-1 Restore (N00) and Restart SPC loads, set the ATP pointer for intercept, and return to QBF operations.  Standing Generic Ops Request 19682 to restore the WFC3 memory monitoring on the CSM motion was also completed at 338/12:53 UTC. 
 
The Payload then successfully resumed the on-going DOY 2019/336 SMS at 338/13:37:49 UTC, returning to nominal science operations.
 
It is worth noting that the recently installed SI Extended Checksum FSW patch releases for ACS, STIS, COS, and WFC3 were all serendipitously activated through the EEPROM to RAM copies performed in the respective instrument Boot to Operate transitions during the course of this recovery.
 


Nov 2019 - SI Extended Checksum FSW Patch Install
--------

Rationale:  ACS Checksum failure due to EDAC RAM corruption (HSTARs 15619, 15688).

A corrupted EEPROM copy to EDAC RAM caused a checksum failure during the post-anneal ACS Boot-to-Operate transition and resulted in ACS suspending during its February 2019 and March 2019 Anneal cycles. Near term ACS mitigation: Updated the EEPROM to EDAC RAM copy and subsequent checksum performed in the Boot-to-Operate transition to include all of EEPROM copied.

Historically, this checksum only included the CS Operate code. Temporary modification to real-time and stored commanding transitions were implemented until an SOI update could be implemented in PRD to increase the number of words to checksum to include the code and patchable constants memory range.

Subsequently SI FSW patch releases were developed to extend the checksum to include code and patchable constants memory for all SIs as the most robust approach to enhance monitoring for future EEPROM copy failures.

Implementing flight software patch releases to extend the EDAC/EXEC RAM checksum ranges for each instrument:
ACS CS 5.17A – JV0037 EEPROM  
COS CS 4.19B – LV0062 EEPROM 
STIS CS 5.02B – OV0012 EEPROM
WFC3 CS 5.02A – IV0040 EEPROM

Installed via 2019/329 SMS (Nov 25,2019) for each SI but activation will occur at the next Boot-to-Operate transition as dictated by on-orbit operations (e.g. instrument safing or suspend recovery).



Jul 30,2019 - SIC&DH lockup
-----------

from Tom B. email to st_all:
Ever since the last servicing mission, Hubble experiences an occasional lockup in the SIC&DH (Science Instrument Command & Data Handling unit), about once a year.  The last one was in January 2018.  The 13th SIC&DH lockup occurred last night at 2:30am EST.  The recovery from these lockups generally takes a day or so, depending upon the timing of the lockup relative to the mission timeline and contacts with the observatory.  With the normal recovery procedures, this particular event would have taken about 34 hours for recovery, just due to an unlucky alignment between the lockup and the timeline.

This past spring, staff at STScI and GSFC developed and tested a new procedure for recovering from an SIC&DH lockup.  The traditional SIC&DH recovery procedure requires constructing new timelines in order to generate and redeliver the necessary memory layout, whereas the new process allows for using the memory layout of the existing timeline.  As a result, we were able to return to science today after 8 hours and 51 minutes, much faster than the previous record of 18 hours and 41 minutes set in the summer of 2016.  Many thanks to all of the staff at STScI and GSFC who worked so hard to return Hubble to science as quickly as possible.

from MOSES report:
First use of CAROLInE recovery method was successful  
Recovery was complete in ~9 hours compared to nominal recovery of 24-36 hours

The RTCS Reload product was provided by the STScI and uplinked
The SI SEs identified the command pointer location to intercept the SMS timeline  
The entire process was successfully completed by 211/14:12 UTC – resuming the on-going science timeline at 15:05 just under 9 hours after the initial Lock-up event

(note: CAROLINE is the new procedure  CU/SDF Accelerated RTCS Ops Loads Initiative Enhancement)
ie these are CU/SDF lockup anomalies within the SI C&DH


Jan 8, 2019 - WFC3 suspends [recovered Jan 15, first image Jan 17]
-----------
From Tom B. email to st_all:
"Yesterday [Jan 8] at 17:23 UTC, the Wide Field Camera 3 on HST suspended operations due to an apparent anomaly on the instrument's UVIS channel.  We are reviewing telemetry to isolate the issue..." 

Jan 15,2019:  Analysis has shown ..anomaly was within the CCD Electronics Box (CEB) for the UVIS channel.  The analysis also demonstrated that it would be safe to reset the electronics and recover the instrument to an operational state, to see if these steps cleared the error.  These steps were performed this morning, with all telemetry values returned to normal.  To be clear, there was no need to switch the instrument to its redundant electronics.  The investigation will continue to determine the cause for the corrupted telemetry that triggered the suspension of operations last week; although the observatory was not passing through the South Atlantic Anomaly at the time of the anomaly, this event might have been triggered by something as simple as a cosmic ray.

GSFC notes
- 10 CEB analog telemetry itmes out-of-limits in error log
- all of CEB telemetry in NED history buffer were affected
- VSTIF testing on ACS ops bench, explore theory with CEB address FIFO & with WFC3 ops bench to validate exect of IBOOTOP3 (CEB/DEB turnons) in CCS STEP mode for recovery


Oct 5, 2018 - G2 fails, G3 doesn't come up
-----------

During LOS at 22:02:19 low mode body rate test failed putting us in high mode, 22:03:42 2 Gyro test failed and entered KFSP, at 22:03:49. High mode body rate test failed. During LOS ACR fired twice for G2 being at stall current.

from TB:
..[A]t the time of the last servicing mission in 2009, HST had 6 functioning gyros: three with "standard" flex leads (G1, G2, & G5), and three with "enhanced" flex leads (G3, G4, & G6).  The latter are intended to mitigate a known failure mode of the gyros.  We expect the enhanced gyros to last approximately five times longer than the standard ones.

Because the last of the standard gyros (G2) has now failed, we are running in a configuration where all of the gyros are enhanced (G3-G4-G6).  We will run in three-gyro mode until another gyro fails (currently expected to be in the early 2020s), at which point we will use the remaining two gyros in sequence (i.e., one gyro mode).  This strategy should preserve gyro capability through the 2020s.

The silver lining here is that Gyro-2 has been misbehaving for about a year, with a higher jitter rate and sporadic periods of failed acquisitions.   There have been several occasions over the past year when we thought Gyro-2 was about to fail, and we have regularly discussed the possibility of proactively turning it off.  With the transition to the G3-G4-G6 configuration, we are hopeful that the performance of the observatory will return to historical norms, and the staff at STScI and GSFC should get a little relief from gyro babysitting.

Follow-up from TB:
we are in KFSP and will be for a while yet. Gyro 3 came up with an extremely high bias rate (saturating in low state and orders of magnitude higher than normal in high state).  We've tried toggling the state a couple times with no luck. There are some other things we can try, but for now we're standing down to investigate and ponder the options...
[note: as of Oct 8, B3 hasn't been able to come up in stable state]

NOTE: small changes in DEB & other temperatures due to switch in gyros, from 1,2,4 (RSU 1,2) to 2,4,6 (RSU 1,2,3)

Aug 28/29,2018 - string GS/reacq failures
--------------

Combination of large gyro-2 bias shifts, spoiler stars in the FGS field of view, and a failed FHST map resulted in 3 GS acq and four reacq failures. Real Time commanding uplinked the Gyro Rate Bias estimate and commanded OBAD (On-Board Attitude Determination) with an attitude correction.

More mitigation to reduce number of gyro-2 failures to RGA mode: use HST486 Autonomous Commanding Routine (ACR), does not require FSW. HST 486 uses ACRs to monitor combinations of software (S/W) and hardware (H/W) data and to perform a predefined command macro if the data remains out of limits for a specified period of time.

July 17, 2018 recentering loss-of-lock
-------------

Large V1 error introduced due to a [gyro-induced] V2 disturbance resulted in re-centering loss-of-lock. On June 12, 2018 thresholds for entering recentering for Vehicle Control Law Position Path were changed (to less GS failures due to increased jitter):
V1 from 200 to 400 masec
V2 left at 20masec
V3 from 20 to 80 masec

However recentering is currently not needed to address vehicle disturbances and is contributing to losses of lock so disabling will improve science efficiency. Lack of recentering events should lead to fewer losses of lock.

That is, the recentering logic was initially put in place to allow the FGS units to hold lock during SA disturbances by opening the loop temporarily. These disturbances are no longer seen with SA3 and teh recentering logic is now causing problems. Recentering is being entered during V2 disturbances and the FGS units lose lock because of failing to track motion during that time. This is especially true with the current motion from Gyro 2 instability.

More information from OLL:
-	July 13 – Large Attitude Error Event Summary: ~18 deg/hr rate bias in both V2 and V3 was erroneously produced when the FGS acquisition expire timer terminated the Re-acquisition at the same time that the Attitude Observer Initialization (AOI) process was collecting FGS data for initializing the attitude observer.  
o	large rate bias tripped the Low Mode Body Rate Safing Test which in turn initiated the commanding to place the Gyros in High Mode. 
o	Attitude error increased to 42 degrees. HST remained power positive; telemetry was recovered by RT commanding using the low gain antennas. 
o	Following real time commands to update the onboard “commanded” quaternion, the team commanded HST to SMS attitude.  
o	Science ops resumed approximately 5 hours after the anomaly. 
-	To prevent re-occurrence of the anomaly, FGS acquisition logic will be modified. Modifications include disabling the AOI processing prior to terminating the FGS re-acq.  Acq Logic-I will be uplinked later in August (Ops Brief on Monday Aug 6 @ 1:30PM)
-	A process in the FGS Acquisition Logic that was put in place years ago facilitate the FGSs in holding fine lock during Solar Array Disturbances (called Re-centering logic) now has a deleterious effect in this era of large G2-induced disturbances. The re-centering logic was disabled on July 20.
-	The Acquisition failure rates have been dramatically reduced by the mitigations (increasing the sampling frequency (reduce sampling rate from 50ms to 25ms) and adding OBADs in front of re-acqs).
o	Latest Stats (From Mike Wenz) – for week of July 23:  failure rate to RGA Hold was 2.63%;
total failure rate was 5.26%. The number of failures to Independent RGA hold was 2. 




Apr 21, 2018 - +V3 KFSP mode after Gyro 1 fail
------------

Kalman Filter Sun Point (KFSP) Safe Mode -- Sun point control law using combination of CSS, MSS, and any number of gyros.  Faster Sun capture. Aperture Door remains open.

Gyro 1 motor current dropped to 0 at 2018/111 10:44, indicating flex lead B failure. HST enters KFSP mode when system momentum check failed at 2018/111 10:49:42.

Based on anomaly briefing: Gyro 1 will not be powered on 1) flex lead failure is understood, gyro will not successfully restart with only 1 flex lead and 2) do not want to disturb Gyro 2 (given its recent issues)

SI's had nominal safemode response. WFC3 remained in Operate (IR Hold), had just completed science data dump so no images in the buffer, anneal was performed the day before.

Gyros 6 and 5 have been powered on in preparation for a new operational configuration of 2-4-6-3.

Ops Request 20220 was executed and recovery from KFSP is complete.
Gyro temperatures have stabilized and gyro 6 is running nominally.
The health and safety SMS began executing at 112/0000.

Details from T.Brown:
Around 8am local time on Saturday morning, Gyro-1 on Hubble suffered a failure and the spacecraft entered safemode.  We have powered on Gyro-6.  It needs to warm up for about 24 hours, after which we can start phasing in normal activities as we recover the observatory.

At the time of the last servicing mission in 2009, HST had 6 functioning gyros: three with "standard" flex leads, and three with "enhanced" flex leads, with the latter intended to mitigate a known failure mode of the gyros.  We expect the enhanced gyros to last approximately five times longer than the standard ones.

Before this morning's failure of Gyro-1, we had the following gyros:

Gyro	Status	Type		Hours
G1		On		Standard		43000
G2		On		Standard		43000
G3		Off		Enhanced	22000
G4		On		Enhanced	88000
G5		Failed	Standard		51000
G6		Off		Enhanced	36000

With the failure, we are changing from gyros 1-2-4 to gyros 2-4-6.  Gyro-2 has been showing signs of degradation for the past year, and when it fails, we will start Gyro-3.  At that point, we will be operating on three enhanced gyros. Although we expect those gyros to last for years, if one eventually fails, we will use the last two gyros sequentially, running one at a time, with some degradation in HST performance, but maximizing the lifetime of this unique and powerful observatory.  We expect HST to continue pursuing amazing science into the mid-2020s, providing significant overlap with the JWST mission.  

As always, we are grateful to all of the staff at STScI and GSFC who work so hard to keep the observatory safe and return to science as soon as possible when these anomalies occur.

 


Apr 2,2018 - reacq timing changes
-----------

In response to the recent increase in Take Data Late (TDF) cases for FGS reacquisition, two changes are being made as recommended by the GSAWG. One is the STScI has changed their timing starting with 18 reacquisitions in next week’s SMS to allow an extra 20 seconds. The change is expected to be for all reacquisitions in future SMSs. The other change is in the FSW On-Board Reacquisition/Loss of Lock to shorten the timing by 15 seconds.
We would like to hold an Operations Briefing for the FSW Timing change on Monday, 3/26/18 from 3:30 – 4:30 PM in B3/S107A. Commanding is anticipated to be Wednesday morning.

From flight systems engineering report:
In an effort to mitigate the Reacquisition late TDF problems that we were experiencing from the Gyro 2 bias issues, the GSAWG approved two changes that have been implemented on orbit.
Starting with the 2018.092 SMS (April 2), STScI modified reacquisition durations to include an additional 20 seconds before SI observing, increasing the start-to-end time for pair Reacquisitions from 266 to 286 seconds. 
On March 28 a FSW patch was executed per Ops Request 20204 to change the wait time prior to the Science Initialization command from 40 seconds to 25 seconds for reacquisitions.
This will cause the TDF to come up 15 seconds earlier in the Reacquisition logic than before.
Since these adjustments, there have not been any Reacquisition late TDF issues not attributable to star problems, though there have been cases that would have been late if these mitigations had not been put into place. 



Mar 5,2018 - HST aft shroud pressure puff
----------

NCS/ASCS ESM TPS puff observed (see 180305*jpg)

Note from Chris L.:
Another “puff” was detected by the NCS aft shroud pressure gauge earlier this week. I do not have any insight into the source but it should be appreciated that this ion pump (it is a pump, not a true gauge) is way past its end-of-life. If the pressure calibration is correct and this pump was being operated on the ground it would have long ago depleted its consumable supply of titanium. Why it continues to operate has not been explained but perhaps the actual pressure is lower than reported or there are zero-gravity effects that have not been appreciated. In any case I’ve never seen a pump operated to titanium exhaustion because on the ground sputtering products cause the pumps to fail prior to reaching this level of usage. So while I have no evidence that the age of the pump could generate such “puff” readings I thought I’d take this moment to remind the community that we are in uncharted territory with this device.



Jan 19 2018 - SIC&DH lockup
-----------

Note from Tom B.:
Late on Friday afternoon, the SIC&DH (Science Instrument Command & Data Handling unit) on HST experienced its 12th lockup since Servicing Mission 4.  The flight and science operations staff at GSFC and STScI responded quickly, and we returned to science late this afternoon. 

As a followup to last week's message, Solid State Recorder 3 (SSR3) continues to function well, and was returned to science operations alongside SSR1 on Tuesday.

On the same day, the NCS pressure gauge reported a jump in aft shroud pressure from a background level of 9x10-8 to 1.8x10-7 Torr. The “puff” resolved over several minutes (see *puff.jpg). The system is not operating (warm) but stable with the exception of circulator loop gas leakage slowly causing loop depressurization.



Oct 2017 - Gyro 2 issues
--------

- First event on Oct 15: large gyro bias (254 as/hr) change, 1 GS acq failure
- Oct 19: rotor restriction (168 to 212 mA) and stall event at 11:42, 13:30
  restriction caused loss of lock & subsequent GS reacq failure
  stall casued Momentum & Low Mode counters to increment, body rate test failed, enters high mode
        triggered running of restart ACR (powers gyro off then restarts before spins down)
        motor current successfully restored
	---> without ACR, would have gone into KFSP sunpoint safe
        resulting bias shift (-350 as/hr) & high mode cause loss of lock, 3 GS reacq & 1 GS acq failures
- if continues: will reconfigure to 1-4-6-2 (2 in shadow mode)
  will further protect against safe mode


Aug 10,2017 - real-time proc error safes COS/STIS; WFC3 unaffected
------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary: On August 10, NSSC-1 reached the SPC list exhaust and safed COS and STIS at 222/17:59 (HSTAR 14808)
QBF transfers were disabled to complete the commanding to dump the NSSC-1 memory, but they were not re-enabled.
To expedite recovery, the decision was made to restore and configure the SIs in real-time rather than wait for an intercept SMS. 
Recovery was completed in about half the time of a typical recovery, and WFC3 and ACS were able to resume science in just a few hours (WFC3 was in anneal, commanding picked up before cooldown ie no effect to WFC3)
The instruments were recovered and the timeline resumed by 223/06:18

In more detail:=
At ~22/17:59, an ESB was received indicating that the QBF transfer had failed.  This resulted in list exhaust being reached in the NSSC-1 SMS, causing COS and STIS to safe.  The NSSC-1 remained in normal mode and WFC3 and ACS remained in operate.  There is no currently running SMS in the NSSC-1.
 
The SI SE team is developing ops requests to set the ATP pointer to resume the science timeline for WFC3 and ACS, with the intention of recovering COS and STIS in real time. 

The QBF transfer failure was confirmed to be the result of the QBF transfers not being re-enabled following the commanding at about 222/14:14.
 
In the forward at 222/20:25, Ops Requests 20095 and 20097 were executed to uplink the NSSC-I SPC loads, set the NSSC-I ATP, and re-enable QBF transfers.
This was executed in time to allow the WFC3 anneal commanding to continue uninterrupted.  Ops Request 20098 will be executed in the next forward support to
close the ACS calibration door.  A meeting will be held at 5:30 PM local time on the anomaly line to review the commanding for recovery of STIS and COS later this evening.
The timing for the recoveries will be posted on SAS after the meeting.  A flash report will be issued when both instruments have been recovered.
 
HSTAR 14808 has been generated to cover this event.
  
COS and STIS entered their safe states this afternoon at ~222/17:59UT (1:59pm EDT). The root cause was a real-time procedural error which prevented the next expected command load from being transferred into the NSSC memory for execution. This resulted in a NSSC-1 command list exhaust and that triggered the resulting instrument safings. The 486 computer and command timeline were not affected and continued to execute the SMS generated spacecraft command load. After engineering analysis and a project briefing, the decision was made to manually load the current expected command load into NSSC-1 memory and reset the ATP (Absolute Time Processor) to resume WFC3 and ACS SMS command execution as soon as practical. That was possible because WFC3 and ACS were and remained in their default operate state throughout the event. That load and ATP pointer reset activity was successfully executed at ~222/20:25UT (4:25pm EDT), and WFC3 and ACS SMS command execution have been subsequently verified.  

HST Operations and Project management also gave the go-ahead to recover COS and STIS in realtime later this evening and tonight. COS recovery activities will begin around day 223/01:46UT (9:46pm EDT), with STIS recovery commanding to begin around 223/04:35 (12:30pm tonight). All recovery activities should be completed will before their next use in the SMS later tomorrow morning.

Note added later: recovery went as planned, thanks to the rapid and expert response of the flight SE and ME’s, with support from our STScI engineers, we expect that only 4 prime GO orbits, 2 SNAPs, and 3 calibration parallels will have been impacted by this event.



Jun 20,2017 - SI C&DH lockup (WFC3 remained cold)
--------------------------------------------------

At 171/02:34 the SSM486 reported the SIC&DH Toggle Test had failed.  At 171/02:36,  the alert system sent out the message Identifying the cause as a CU/SDF Lock-up event.  This is the 11th Lock-up event seen since the unit was installed in SM-4. The last lock-up was on 3/16/2017.
 
Prior to the CU/SDF lockup, nominal NSSC-1 and HST486 SMS timelines were executing. 
Lock-up occurred at 171/02:33 UTC.

The intercept SMS to truncate the current week’s SMS is expected to be delivered ~1200 UTC (8am) and will begin at 1600 UTC.  The return to science SMS will be delivered ~22 UTC  and will begin at 172/0200 UTC.


Mar 16, 2017 - SI C&DH lockup (WFC3 remained cold)
--------------------------------------------------
At AOS, HST reported an SIC&DH Lockup event that occurred at 75/08:43:56.  The 486 SMS commanding is continuing with no NSSC-1 SMS.  Response matches past events. 

Following the CU/SDF lockup anomaly at 075/08:42, the SI subsystem has been recovered successfully.  The SI C&DH is in Normal mode and all the science instruments have been recovered to their nominal intercept states.  In addition, all instruments and the SI C&DH telemetry appear nominal following the recovery commanding.    
 
The above activities were executed via Ops Requests 20027, 20028. The NSSC-1 GPTM table will be loaded and dumped via Ops Request 20029.
 
The SI subsystem is now in the proper configuration for the intercept SMS.  The Health and Safety SMS was delivered this evening around 1:15pm local time and the Return to Science SMS will be delivered around 5:30 pm.  Afterwards, SI SEs, FOT, and NOM will remain onsite to process and load the science SMS.
 
At 075/05:11 UTC,  Return to Science SMS was successfully intercepted. The NSSC1 ATP started to increment and everything has been working nominally. Nominal science operations have already resumed with WFC3 observations beginning at 075/05:21:15 UTC.


Jan 13, 2017 - SI C&DH lockup (WFC3 remained cold)
--------------------------------------------------
SI C&DH lockup occurred Fri, Jan 13, 2017 16:58:02. HST was in LOS at the time. All telemetry at AOS was nominal for other subsystems. The SI system indicated the expected lockup response. Nominal recovery began at 19:20 UTC. SI SEs will continue executing OPS requests this evening. H&S SMS will be delivered ~7:30pm EST and being 014 10:30 UTC. Return to science SMS will be delivered ~9:30pm EST to start ~014 17:30 UTC. An additional SMS will be delivered later to replace the 016 SMS>


Jul 31,2016 - SI C&DH lockup / WFC3 kernel reset performed (no longer needed in Sep)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SI C&DH lockup occurred Sun, Jul 31, 213/05:59 UT, and as a result HST safed. As before, no communication with SIs until fixed. Cause unknown, no obvious fix except to power-cycle SI C&DH. First one of these for WFC3: June 2009, ~1/yr (3 in 09 & none in 2013, 2015).
 
Nominal recovery time of 214/00:00:00 UT. First post-safing exposures for each instrument/detector
WFC3 UVIS 214:00:13:19
...
Event was similar to previous lockups. Recovery occurred by 214:00:00 ie in ~19 hrs, a record! WFC3 did not warm up; bowtie exposures after WFC3 was brought back up were nominal.

Two HSTARs have been written to document this morning’s events.  HSTAR 14576 covers the CU/SDF Lock-up, while HSTAR 14577 covers a correction to a verifier in COP 9.21 noted during the course of the recovery. 


Jul 10,2016 - FIFO error on dark image
--------------------------------------

HSTAR 14562 file: UVIS FIFO not empty at end of readout on 192/0136Z. 
Program affected: 14370, prog D0K, obset 12, dark-nm, F390M.
SMS 2016.192:01:17.28. QL reports no obvious degradation of science data.



Jun 20,2016 - STIS suspend
--------------------------

Summary from Scott Swain:
At 2016/171:20:2801 UTC (4:28 pm EDT), the NSSC-1 posted a STIS 104 status buffer message, parameter ‘62’O (50 dec) indicating that the instrument Suspended due to a Control Section reset resulting from an Intel page fault exception.   Shortly after receipt and the initial engineering diagnosis and response, a status meeting was arranged for 6:30 pm EDT to review all the findings to date and the forward plan.  Charts are posted on the Systems Management website at:  https://edocs.hst.nasa.gov/hstsysman/Briefings/AnomalyBrief/STISsuspend_19June16.pptx
 
A brief summary of the discussion follows:
 
Upon review of the events leading up to and at the time of the Suspend, the vehicle was known to be in a deep (L1 or L2) SAA passage, during orbit day, and quiescent from the perspective of STIS and entire Payload.  Other subsystems reported nothing unusual in their telemetry.  A review of STIS telemetry around the event is on-going, but is not expected to reveal any issues.
 
The on-call FOT, SI SE, ARM, and CMOM reported to GSFC and successfully completed Ops Request 19928 at 171/22:14 UTC (6:14 pm EDT) to execute ROP NS-10, dumping STIS memory following a Suspend.  Resulting Exec RAM, EEPROM, and CS Buffer RAM files were provided to Payload FSW for analysis.  Initial results of this analysis show the reason for reset as an Intel page fault exception, confirming the error parameter of ‘62’O (50 dec) reported in the status buffer.  No other items of interest were noted in the error log or other areas.  Results of the full analysis are forthcoming, but, again, are not expected to reveal any other issues. 
 
This Suspend event is likely to be the result of a Single Event Upset (SEU)-induced error.  Other instruments have suffered other flavors of Intel exceptions in the past, including both NICMOS and ACS.  It is recommended that the instrument may simply be recovered nominally and returned to science operations shortly thereafter after stabilization. 
 
The forward plan portion of the status meeting was led primarily by the STScI.  STIS is being heavily utilized towards the front of the imminent DOY 2016/172 SMS, limiting recovery possibilities tonight and well into tomorrow.  The best option for recovery is expected to be via stored commanding in an intercept SMS later in the week.  Several JUNO support visits are the driving factor in completion of the recovery prior to approximately DOY 174/05:00 UTC.  The STScI will be working on a support schedule for the replan and will likely work towards delivery of products tomorrow afternoon or early evening. 
 
A tag-up on the telemetry and FSW analysis results to date, as well as the forward plan for recovery and resumption of STIS science will be held at 9:00 am EDT Monday morning, 20 June, following the morning status briefing. 
 
  



May 9,2016 - WFC3 thermal low-limit violation
---------------------------------------------

WFC3 radiator hit end of calcurve at -55 C, determined to be due to particularly cold attitude maintained for extended period of time (HSTR 14531). Cal curve gets coarse quickly < -55 but can be taken down to -80 (constraint is -70 as ammonia in heat pipes freezes at -77C). Raw counts indicate probably wasn't much below -56 C. Heaters are powered directly from PDU, located on spreader heat pipes so heat can dissipate across radiator as evenly as possible. Those setpoints are controlled by fixed thermostats, characteriszed during TV2 (results in SE-02 Table 4.2.1.2). They were spec'd to have -50C setpoints with 3.5C deadband, found to activate at  -51.3C, -53.65C, -55.98C, and -52.8C. The fact that the raw counts show that it didn’t get colder than -56C for IDRIRT lends credibility to that heater having come on at -56C like we saw in TV2 (there is no telemetry on these heaters). SI SE's looking into extending curve & reset ground limit to -60C. WFC3 should never get there but if it does, would mean probably heater is failing or attitude is off-nominal for longer than heater can manage (requiring pointing constraints).

 
Oct 2015: gyro 4 showing large bias shifts
------------------------------------------

Gyro 4 has had another large bias shift this morning between about
7-8am.  Previously, the rate of change of the bias shift was fairly
short (an orbit or two).  Currently, the rate of change of the bias
shift is still fairly large, but so far is decreasing with time.  So
far, we have lost no science observations due to this latest G4 issue. 

However, we have one of the Benneki exoplanet observations, 13665 visit
02, coming up at about 2am EDT Saturday morning and running for 4
orbits.  This observation will put us in a situation where we would not
be able to get an autonomous gyro bias update for about 8 hours.  With
this latest G4 issue, that will likely cause problems without
intervention. The autonomous gyro bias updates are performed by the 486
when the spacecraft is under FGS-pair guiding and no maneuvers are
being performed.  If a minimum of 20 minutes during the visibility meet
these conditions, that data is used to perform the gyro bias update
prior to the termination of FGS guiding.  

The plan is to uplink a change at about 4:50pm to modify the onboard
value from 20 minutes to 5 minutes.  This should allow for the
autonomous gyro bias updates to occur during the 4 orbit Benneki visit
and the system to take care of itself without further intervention.
However, if there wind up still being problems with the Benneki visit,
the FOT is poised to come in at 6am tomorrow morning to perform a
manual gyro bias update to hopefully allow the following visit's GSACQ
to succeed (3-orbit 13801 visit 08). Since this change to the minimum
data collection interval will have no effect on most orbits (we usually
collect 30+ minutes per orbit), the long-term plan is to leave the
updated 5 minute minimum in place until Gyro 4 dies.

Gyro 4.s motor still remains high at approximately 180 milliamps as
compared with the nominal motor current of approximately 130 milliamps.
This has the signature of a non-destructive .lube patch. that
temporarily increases the gyro.s motor current until it is restarted.
Gyro 4 has also been displaying erratic bias jumps and this may be the
signature of a impending failure. The PCS folks are prepared to switch
out gyro 4 is necessary.


Several IR telemetry points shifted by small amounts after Kernel Timer reset Sep 2015
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During Sep anneal (2014.254 15:31:27, Sep 11), kernel timer counter was reset.
The reset requires a reboot which can be conveniently 'hidden' after anneal.
During this reset, some IR parameters shifted slightly:
   IRBDACHI (ADC bias high, pg266)               from -1.973 V to -1.9735 V
   IRDACREF (ADC ref, pg267)                     from 5.03 V to 5.031 V
   IR1M1 (IR quads 1&2 -1 VDC, pg 279)		 from -1.012 V to -1.015 V
   IR3FB1 (IR quads 3&4 fixed bias V, pg 290)    from 0.73 V   to ~0.729 V
   IR3FB2 (IR quads 3&4 fixed bias V2, pg 291)   from 3.4012 V to 3.4013 V
   IR3M1 (IR quads 3&4 -1 VDC, pg 295)           -1.015 V got slightly noisier
(Page numbers are those from telemetry trend slide set sent out by CLong.)
Previous resets did not show such shifts.


HST safing June 4 2015 01:59 (2015.155; WFC3 not warmed up)
-----------------------------------------------------------

At 155/01:59 (Wednesday  9:59 PM), the NSSC-1 initiated safing
resulting in halting the NSSC-1 SPC pointer and safing both COS and
STIS.  A level 2 alert was issued and an anomaly meeting was held this
evening on the conference line.  Initial investigation leads to a
belief that a QBF SPC load for the NSSC-1 was not uplinked to the
spacecraft after loads were reconfigured on the ground system for an
intercept SMS.  Result was an SPC list exhaust in the NSSC-1. The
spacecraft and instruments are in a safe state.  The HST486 SPC load is
continuing to operate but there is no SI commanding. All subsystems
verified their data this evening to ensure there are no other anomalous
indications.  EPS just saw the expected changes resulting from COS and
STIS safing.  

ACS and WFC3 were both in their nominal Operate states and remain
there, unaffected by the soft safing. Although none of the instruments
were observing at the time, one WFC3 UVIS image remains in its buffer
memory.




Slight pressure spike on July 28,2014
-------------------------------------

The HST NCS pressure sensor reported an aft shroud pressure transient
from the baseline of 1.07x10-7 to 3.92x10-7 Torr at 0941 on Day 209,
2014 (July 28).

The MEGG shows HST exiting the SAA having just completed a T4 slew with
no observation underway. No HSTARs or Ops Requests were logged near
this time. Space weather was benign and meteor activity was low. All
other payload telemetry indicates nominal operation.

Spacecraft systems not showing any anomalies so it's likely the source
for the pressure transient is intermittent leakage from the NCS
circulator loop O-rings due to the continuing system depressurization.
There are limited sources of gas (including vapors) available to spoil
the vacuum, and O-ring sealed systems tend to form leaks under similar
conditions. There's no way to know if this could lead to a sudden loss
of circulator loop pressure placing HV systems at risk but it is
something to revisit. The only mitigation of this possibility would be
to proactively vent the loop which would likely require powering off
the FHSTs, not something likely to be recommended.

So far, there have been two pressure transient events, the other
occurring on day 282, 2013. For now, taking a wait-and-see approach and
continue to monitor vacuum on a monthly basis looking for signs of a
deteriorating situation.

End of March, 2014

A number of enclosure and electronics board temperatures dropped by
about 1C and have remained there ever since. Examples are in WFC3

HST Gyro 5 has failed - March 7, 2014
-------------------------------------

Email to st_all from K.Sembach: HST entered safe mode this morning due
to the (anticipated) failure of Gyro 5. I wrote to you about the
failing health of this gyro two weeks ago. The observatory and its
instrumentation are healthy and configured safely, exactly as they
should be. However, the gyro is no longer usable. Over the next few
days, the STScI and GSFC operations teams will be working together on a
variety of recovery tasks. 

The first order of business will be to bring two of the hibernating
gyros online for use by Hubble's pointing and control system. HST
will then have four gyros powered, with a fifth in reserve. After
about a week or so, one of those four gyros will be powered off for use
later in the mission, and Hubble will operate in standard 3-gyro mode. 

The gyros will be monitored over the weekend, and their drift rates
will be tuned to assure the performance necessary to point Hubble
accurately. In the meantime, we will be preparing a revised observing
plan while Hubble's science instruments are brought back online.

We expect to resume awesome Hubble science sometime late tomorrow
(Saturday). Note from Ken later: "...Hubble's science instruments have
been transitioned to their operating modes, and all were conducting
science observations over the weekend.   The science timeline was
picked up around noon Saturday with observations made by the Cosmic
Origins Spectrograph, followed soon thereafter by observations with the
Wide Field Camera 3 and the Advanced Camera for Surveys.  Space
Telescope Imaging Spectrograph observations resumed on Sunday.
[Saturday = 3/8/2014, day 067] ... In all,  Hubble was down for less
than about 30 hours after the gyro failed."

HST Gyro 5 has flex lead failure - Feb 22,2014
----------------------------------------------

Email to st_all from K.Sembach: HST Gyro 5 experienced a flex lead
failure this weekend, which will shorten the remaining useful life of
the gyro. If lucky, we may get another month or two of run time on the
gyro before it fails completely.

HST uses gas-bearing gyros to sense changes in its position.  The full
complement of six gyros was replaced during SM4, and today all 6 gyros
are usable in their present condition. At any given time, we run three
gyros to maximize scheduling flexibility, while preserving lifetime on
the other three.  There are multiple failure modes for these gyros,
one of them being flex lead failures like the one just experienced on
Gyro 5.

The flex leads are wires the width of a human hair that serve as the
internal electrical connection to the fluid-filled portion of the gyro
that contains the gyro elements responsible for sensing motion.  Each
gyro contains two flex leads. These wires decay over time, as the
copper in the silver-copper alloy comprising the wire interacts with
trace amounts of bromine in the fluid. Eventually this decay causes an
electrical open circuit, and the flex lead is no longer useful. The
speed of this decay is hastened by heat, which is why the second flex
lead often decays very quickly after the first is lost.  Once the
first lead becomes an open circuit, the second lead has to carry twice
the current, and heats up accordingly, hastening the decay.

Gyro 5 has "traditional" flex leads - the kind that have been used in
HST's gyros throughout the mission.  Three of the six gyros replaced
during SM4 are of this type.  The three others are "enhanced" flex
leads, which have a sliver plating on the leads that (presumably)
protects the silver-copper alloy from degradation.  The enhanced-lead
gyros also had some other production enhancements that should help to
extend their usable lifetimes as well.

HST is currently running on Gyros 4-5-6 (enhanced-standard-enhanced
leads). When Gyro 5 (standard lead) fails, HST will enter safe mode,
and it will take us approximately 1-2 days to recover the science
timeline safely. The currently approved gyro contingency plan is to
turn off Gyro 6 (enhanced lead) and turn on Gyros 1 and 2 (both
standard leads) so that the standard lead gyros are used together,
which is prudent since the standard-lead gyros can degrade due to
parasitic heat from a companion gyro even when off. 

The bottom line of all of this is that HST is aging - in a familiar
(and expected) way.  There is no reason to be alarmed, as we have ways
of operating HST with fewer than three gyros should we ever need to do
so again.   For now, we will continue to operate on three gyros as long
as possible, regardless of what happens to Gyro 5, in order to maximize
the science return of the observatory.


Slight pressure spike on Oct 9,2013
-----------------------------------

GSFC evaluation of fourth quarter of 2013 showed spike in  NCS Total
Pressure Sensor (TPS) pressure data right around ~2013/282/02:00 UTC.
WFC3 data evaluated WFC3 data before & after the event were nominal
(SB). More details about the event (S.Swain): it was not huge spike
e.g. like during ACS Side 2 failure in 2007 (>2e-5 torr). The 2013
event rose to ~3x average level where sensor normally trends (~1.44e-7
torr) along with exponential decay over ~2 full min of 10-sec sampled
data (plus 1 sample of rise on front side of event). Sometimes spikes
at this level are seen in trending but often can be attributed to data
transients, though not this one.


Secondary Mirror move on Nov 12, 2013
-------------------------------------
The secondary mirror move was successfully commanded on Tuesday,
November 12, at 12:41 p.m (OPS request 19524) EST. The move of 3
microns is expected to take the imaging instruments from approximately
-2 microns to +1 micron of average secondary mirror offset from best SI
focus. The next visit of the optical monitor program, from which phase
retrieval determinations of focus are derived, will execute on Sunday,
November 17.

Boot-to-Operate on Sep 12,2013 in order to reset kernel time
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The stored commanding to reset the WFC3 kernel time through cycling the
instrument to Boot and back to Operate was run on DOY 255 (September
12, 2013) during part of anneal procedure. Anneal was observed to
complete nominally.

Notes: as for Aug 2012 boot-to-operate procedure, higher level of hot
pixels present after aneal and bowtie-shaped hysteresis occurred and
successfully removed with bowtie visit (this year, had back-to-back
visits). New this year: small shifts in IR bias reference voltages were
seen. No apparent change in data (IR refpix, IR photometry, relative
gain levels as measured from IR intflats all the same before and after
the reboot). HSTAR 13852 filed by S.Swain.


ESB 677 message 118/07:10:31 (Aug 16,2013) - resolved as no problem
-------------------------------------------------------------------

WFC3 issued an ESB 677 message indicating that the kernel timer rolled
over. The 10ms kernel time counter in the flight software rolls over
every 1.1 years if you don窶冲 do a time code date. There had been no
concern when power-cycling MEB every month via anneal. However, with
the switch pre-launch to not power-cycle anything, stored commanding
added a call to ITCUP command to ensure time code update - done a
couple days ago. But that only resets Coarse timer, it does not reset
Kernel timer. There was a possibility images had corrupted time-stamps
but check of data headers showed no problem. WFC3 remained in Operate,
no images lost.

Resolution: WFC3 needs hardware or power-on reset of the MEB which can
be done in a normal transition to Boot and back up to Operate (as is
done for FSW installation). This will reset the Kernel timer. This will
be done over the next anneal (planned for 255/22:32 UTC, Sep 12, 6:32
EDT).

¡™£¢The counters/clocks on WFC3: one is Kernel time (1 tick/10ms, 32bit
value from iRMK operating system; 497 days before roll-over). Second is
the Coarse timer (updates ever 32ms with RIU 1.024-MHz pulse, 30 bit
register; goes 397 days until roll-over). Today is 365 days since last
MEB restart [for CS 5.01 FSW installation Aug 2012). ESB is issued when
either Kernel or Coarse time reflect elapsed time of 365 days, i.e.,
merely warning that roll-over is getting close. Situation confirmed
with memory dump. Unknown what would result if timer is not reset,
perhaps nothing or may garble times.

HSTAR 13769 - Aug 4, 2013
-------------------------

Day 216/16:56:11 UTC, on-call SI SE received notification that WFC3
UVIS Amp A FIFO was not empty when the readout completed. Message was
informational only (detector FIFOs are reset during normal
end-of-readout processing). The readout in question as well as
subsequent images were normal (from calibration proposal 13083,
external CTE monitor). One possible cause is a single-event upset. WFC3
not in SAA at the time of error but the part is similar to the one used
in ACS & STIS, which have previously shown SEU susceptibility. 


HST enters Software-Supoint safe mode - Feb 15, 2013
----------------------------------------------------
From the flash report re: +V3 SWSP on 2/15/13 046/08:11:37  
The team concluded that the SWSP entry was caused by the solar array
command profile test failing due to an overshoot of the +wing by 10.7ｰ
relative to the commanded position, exceeding the 10ｰ threshold.  There
was no immediate no health and safety concern. This is the eighth SADE
slew anomaly of this type, the third with SADE 2-R. The belief is that
all are radiation/EMI induced and are not permanent. As in previous
events, a SADE on-orbit test will be conducted prior to resumption of
the nominal science observation program.  The following information
summarizes the anomaly briefing:
 
More from Ken: Early this morning about 3:12 AM local time, HST entered
what is known as "Software Sunpoint safe mode".   This is one of the
primary (and relatively benign) safemodes that Hubble can enter when
there is a problem with the spacecraft or its primary subsystems.  It
is the same safemode Hubble entered on Christmas Eve, albeit for a
different reason.  In today's case, a slightly off-nominal solar array
slew caused the safing.   During the solar array slew, the measured
position for one of the two arrays differed by more than 10 degrees
from the commanded position for more than 3 seconds.   Hubble's
spacecraft computer recognized that this was not normal, and onboard
safing procedures were executed as expected. The suspected cause of the
solar array deviation is a bit flip in one of the registers in the
Solar Array Drive Electronics.  Such an error can be corrected and is
not expected to be persistent.


Secondary Mirror Move - Jan 24,2013
-----------------------------------

Ops Request 19347 was successfully completed at 024/17:58 to perform a
six step secondary mirror move.  The move commanding for this 3.6
micron adjustment was nominal. Following this, visit 2 of CAL/OTA
13170, the focus monitoring program, was performed on January 26, 2013.
This visit has been analyzed, and phase retrieval determinations of
focus obtained. After modeled temperature corrections were applied, the
mean focus of WFC3 over 1 orbit was found to be equivalent to -0.68
microns at the secondary mirror. ACS was found to be +0.14 microns. The
overall 1 sigma error on the model and measurements is ~1.5 microns, so
the results of -0.68 and +0.14 are not inconsistent with the desired
state of ~1.2 - 1.5 microns. Furthermore these numbers are
significantly more positive than nearly everything obtained in the past
half year, so they very strongly indicate that a move in the right
direction and of approximately the right amount occurred. It is not
possible in a single measurement to accurately measure the focus but
the results obtained are consistent with the belief that the secondary
mirror move went exactly as planned.



HST enters Software-Sunpoint safe mode - Dec 23, 2012
-----------------------------------------------------

Safe mode entered because SA slew commands were inadequately spaced.
Note from Ken Sembach: "Last night Hubble entered software sunpoint
safemode.  This safing occurred as the result of timing issues
associated with multiple solar array moves while the vehicle was
performing a dog-leg slew to set up for the next astronomical
observation.   Dog-leg slews are rare for Hubble, but are occasionally
needed to avoid the solar exclusion zone when moving from one target to
the next.   As Hubble slews, the solar arrays are often moved to ensure
that there will be sufficient electrical power at the new observatory
attitude.  In this particular case, the arrays needed to be moved
twice, once during each leg of the vehicle dog-leg maneuver.  Initial
analysis suggests that the timing of the commanding for the two solar
array moves collided, thereby resulting in failure of the standard test
that checks to see if the solar arrays moved properly.  Given the
importance of the solar array positioning to the health of the
observatory (no solar power = huge problems), Hubble did what it was
supposed to do - it put itself into an appropriate power-positive safe
mode and waited for help from the ground.  The timing problem has
likely been lurking in the ground system for 20+ years, but has not
manifested itself previously because the combination of a dog-leg
vehicle slew with multiple solar array moves is so rare.  Our team will
perform new timing checks manually until a software fix can be put in
place to make sure we do not encounter this type of event in the
future. "



FSW Update Aug 16,2012 - UVIS shutter will still open even if TDF down
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The update changes the WFC3 shutter operation when the TDF (take data
flag) is down at the beginning of long (>200s) exposures. This change
will allow possible salvage of data if the TDF comes up late. There are
no health & safety concerns for the WFC3/CCD.

Previous behavior:
1) exptime < 200s: ignore TDF state, open shutter for full exposure
2) exptime > 200s: if TDF down at exposure start, never open shutter,
set exptime = 0

New behavior:
1) exptime < 200s: ignore TDF state, open shutter for full exposure
2) exptime > 200s: ignore TDF state, open the shutter. BUT: if TDF
state changes (goes down), then the shutter is closed for the remainder
of the exposure (exptime keyword updated appropriately)

Note: in new FSW, TDFNUM and TDF time information remain 0, generic
conversion will not indicate that TDF was down at the start. EXPTIME is
still correct (shutter was open even if TDF down) but EXPFLAG will
indicate the condition (will use TDFBEGIN for the string 'TDF down').



Exposure limit for a visit increased from ~100 to 304 - July 4,2011
-------------------------------------------------------------------

June 16-18 -- FSW testing/reviews
June 22	   -- FSW software activated, followed by STScI installation of
new Trans executable that supports increased image headers
July 4     -- Trans software available for July 4th SMS processing

In the past, science header buffer limits required a buffer dump after
the acquisition of ~100 images even if the science data buffer was not
yet full, a situation occasionally encountered when taking subarrays.
New commanding and ground system updates now set the science header
buffer limit at 304 image headers. Assuming the data buffer limit is
not exceeded, 304 images can be taken before an image dump is required.
Note that 'image' in this context is a UVIS frame or a single IR
readout (IR sample sequences can contain up to 16 images).

The WFC3 CS 5.0 (IV0037) Flight Software is expected to be uplinked
this week during days 167-169 [June 16-18,2011].  As a result, special
considerations were taken into account during the scheduling and the
PASS processing.

Day 167 (Thurs): No WFC3 usage from 14:00-21:45UT (10am - 5:45pm)
                 No MAT-LEI reduction during that timeframe which
		 leaves a conservative count of 180+ minutes of
		 forward time.
		 
Day 168 (Fri):   No WFC3 usage from 12:00-00:00UT (8am - 8pm)
                 No MAT-LEI reduction during that timeframe which
		 leaves a conservative count of 300+ minutes of
		 forward time.
		 
Day 169 (Sat):   WFC3 observations throughout 12:00-00:00UT (8am - 8pm)
                 No MAT-LEI reduction during that timeframe.
		 Counting forward time between WFC3 observations
		 leaves a conservative count of 170+ minutes of
		 forward time.  This day is contingency.


WFC3 FSW update - June 2011

WFC3 FSW CS 5.00 was activated. This requires a
Operate-to-Boot-to-Operate transitions that copies the new operate
image from EEPROM to EXEC RAM where the operate code executes from.  CS
5.00 was installed into EEPROM earlier.

UVIS internals under new CSM management - June 2010
---------------------------------------------------

CSM is now automatically placed in IR position when taking UVIS biases
and darks (vice-versa for IR darks). The first UVIS internal taken in
this configuration is part of 11905 monitoring program, taken at
2010.173:02:04:52.000. NOTE: Cycle 17 anneal proposal not retrans'd so
internals associated with it (11909) after June2010 have CSM=UVIS.

IR darks had been using CSM=UVIS since July 5, 2009 via manual
specification in APT of special commanding  but now have auto-CSM=UVIS
as well. Handful of IR darks in Aug 2009 plus darks in Oct-Nov 2009
still have CSM=IR.


more cooldown time in anneal procedure - Oct 16,2009 
----------------------------------------------------

The anneal procedure commanding has been changed to allow more time for
cooldown after the anneal. Originally, there was a 1 hr wait between
the TECFIRE enable and the start of CCD preheat to operate. However,
during the Sep 2009 anneal, the power draw reached a high of 256w,
relatively close to the limit of 263w. The new commanding includes an
additional 3 hours wait which provides time for the radiator to cool
off before it receives more TEC load, thus reducing the required power.
This same wait has also been inserted into the "Boot to Operate"
reconfiguration (used e.g. during recovery of the instrument after
safings).

Oct 20, 2014
------------
Lockup of Science Instrument Control & Data Handling unit occurred at
2014/293 1722UTC. Such lockups have occurred previously; this is the
fifth since SM4. The last event was in June 2012 (rate estimated at 1-2
per year). WFC3 did not warm up. Science observation resumed on October
22, 2014, at 04:20 UTC.

Initial engineering note: TelAlert issued a spacecraft problem
notification at 2014/293 1722UTC. STScI engineering has confirmed a
standard SIC&DH lockup signature (except ACR3 was not picked up by the
analysis system). The spacecraft continues to operate normally although
there is no communication with the payload. It is assumed that the
science instruments have dropped into the pseudo-Boot state. Following
SI SE verification of the lockup approval will be sought to recover the
payload per contingency operating procedure 9.21.

June 2, 2012
------------
SIC&DH lockup occurred at 13:48. Engineering note: TelAlert issued a
spacecraft problem notification at 2012/154 1348UTC. STScI engineering
has confirmed a standard SIC&DH lockup signature. 


Sep 27, 2011
------------

An electronic upset in SIC&DH (Science Instrument Control and Data
Handling Unit) occurred 270/09:37:52 UT. The SIC&DH contains the
payload computer as well as the electronics necessary for formatting
the science data and communicating with the science instruments. Such
upsets have been seen before (see below) and are expected to continue
to occur occasionally. This is the first one seen in over a year (the
last was Sep 9, 2010). The lockup had the same characteristics as
previous incidents so the standard SI and SIC&DH realtime recovery
procedures were performed. WFC3 recovery to Operate was successfully
completed at 270/17:08 UTC. 

An ACS anneal was in progress when the lock-up happened, so ACS was
safed to stop the anneal. Intercept science schedules were prepared by
operations team here at STScI. These observing timelines were uploaded
to the observatory over night, and HST resumed science early this
morning Sep 28,2011, less than 24 hours after the upset.

As a side note, one fringe benefit of the lock-up event today allowed
for the verification of the FSW modifications to the MEB reset actions
taken by COS, STIS, and WFC3 that were incorporated on-orbit over the
past year. Three Fixed mode dumps for these SIs analyzed by Payload FSW
indicated that all expected actions were indeed taken. A new SMS is
expected to start at 6am Sep 28, 2011.


 
Oct 4, 2010
-----------

Not a safing but starting at 277/0143z, SDF failed to properly output
science data after a software change was implemented to lower the
SIC&DH temperature by cycling the Science Data Formatter (SDF) inputs
with the outputs.

In response to the failure of the SDF to properly output science data,
the NSSC-1 ATP was inhibited at 277/19:10 and SDF input enabled via Ops
Request 18933.  This was in preparation for the recovery of the SIs and
intercept of the reprocessed SMS (software changed is backed out); SMS
began on 2010.278 14:20:20.00000.


Sep 9, 2010
-----------

The HST Science Instrument and Data Handler (SIC&DH) safed at 252
/22:39:21z. The anomaly is being evaluated to ensure that the signature
is the same as previous events. The last lockup occurred 11/2/09. 

From an email sent by K.Sembach Sep 12,2010:

Thursday evening HST experienced an electronic upset in its Science
Instrument Control and Data Handling Unit (SI C&DH).  This is the
device that contains the payload computer as well as the electronics
necessary for formatting the science data and communicating with the
science instruments.

Such upsets are expected to occur occasionally.  This is the first one
seen in almost a year, and only the fourth since SM4.  The last event
occurred in November 2009, so we have been rather fortunate.  This 
event appeared to be very similar to previous upsets in the Control
Unit / Science Data Formatter section of the SI C&DH.  SI C&DH control
was restored quickly through standard procedures that are now in place
for such events.

All of the science instruments were placed in a safe configuration
following the upset, and an intercept science schedule was prepared by
our operations team here at STScI.  That observing timeline was
uploaded to the observatory yesterday,and HST resumed science late last
night,.



Nov 02,2009

WFC3 now has a modified safe state in which the TECs remain powered.

From Ken Sembach email... 

Yesterday afternoon, the the Control Unit /Science Data  Formatter
(CU/SDF) inside Hubble's Science Instrument Command  & Data Handling
(SI C&DH) unit "locked up" again.  This is the second occurrence of a
lockup in 12 days, and the  third since SM4.  All three events look
very similar, with an exact cause yet to be determined.  At present,
there is no obvious remedy for such lockups other than to power cycle
the  SI C&DH.  Fortunately, the anomalous condition is relatively 
benign, though it is not completely without risk.  An effort to
understand the condition more completely is in progress.

The GSFC and STScI response teams did a super job of restoring 
functionality to the SI C&DH, safing the science instruments,  and
replanning the scheduling timeline to get back to  science early this
evening.  Total recovery time in this case was only ~26 hours, compared
to ~41 hours two weeks ago.   Congratulations to all involved in the
recovery effort.

From Ken Sembach email...

This morning at approximately 8:30 AM, the Control Unit / Science Data
Formatter (CU/SDF) inside Hubble's Science  Instrument Command & Data
Handling (SI C&DH) unit "locked up". If this sounds vaguely familiar,
it's because it has occurred before.  This anomaly, which appears to be
of the same type  as occurred in the middle of June, results in a loss
of  communication with the science instruments (ACS, COS, NICMOS, STIS,
WFC3) until the lockup is cleared.  No commands can get to the
instruments, and no data or  telemetry can get out.

The lockup was cleared successfully by power cycling the  SI C&DH (as
expected).  Soon afterwards, the science  instruments and the NICMOS
Cooling System were configured  into their safe states through
commanding sent from the  ground.  All of the science instruments are
presently  safe and are configured so that they can be brought back  on
line in the coming days with standard recovery procedures.  In the
meantime, our scheduling team is hard at work  preparing for these
activities and a return to science  at the beginning of next week.  On
Monday a decision will  be made about how and when to restart the
NICMOS Cooling  System.

Hubble's other systems (power, communications, attitude  control, FGSs,
etc) continue to function well and were not affected by this anomaly.
